I am an (INTJ) Ph.D candidate at [Department of Earth System Science](https://www.dess.tsinghua.edu.cn), [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn). My major is atmospheric science, and I currently conduct research at the intersection of atmospheric science and artificial intelligence. I started working with Prof. [Haohuan Fu](http://www.thuhpgc.net/mediawiki/index.php/Haohuan_Fu) in Fall 2021, prior to that, I got my Bachelor's degree at [UM-SJTU Joint Institute](https://www.ji.sjtu.edu.cn/cn/), [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](https://www.sjtu.edu.cn), majoring in Mechanical Engineering.
